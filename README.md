This repository contains notebooks and data to predict the results of the 2020 Academy Awards
To try some predictions, open the 'Predictions' notebook and try some of the datasets in the ./data folder.

If you want to refine the features yourself, download the database from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gG5p89A38KlZh0dtjcjvvKVJpD3IlecA?usp=sharing, add it to the ./data folder and use the 'Prepare Features' notebooks to prepare some features.
